# react-app-scaffolding

This scaffolding is to help lay the foundatation for large scalable front end applications, using:
* React
* Redux
  * Duck Pattern
* Webpack
  * Path resolution
  * Code-splitting
  * Hot Module Reloading (Dev server)
* BlueprintJS (UI Component Library)
* SASS Modules
* JWT Middleware
* AWS
  * S3

The idea is to clone the repo, and get started on development right away, with room to grow your application the right way without having to refactor or reorganize your file structure down the road.
