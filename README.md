# react-app-scaffolding

This scaffolding is to help lay the foundatation for large scalable front end applications, using react, redux, webpack, code-splitting, blueprintjs, and AWS S3.

The idea is to clone the repo, and get started on development right away, with room to grow your application the right way without having to refactor down the road.
